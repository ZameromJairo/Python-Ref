# Python-for-data-analysis

The development here were made using a course available on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/share/1066ki3@RlJcNXf1cVgBfLejK6Dvnpwzv10BFIk9Bq3f13qBcqL25NBY9bHaPT0LvmySJElf5w==/

This folder will be used as reference for my next projects, studies and work.

I'm also trying to use Github for code versioning :)
